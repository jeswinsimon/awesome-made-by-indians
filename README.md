# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Awesome Made by Indians [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
> An Awesome list for curating the best projects that were made by Indian developers

## But why?

We were looking for ways to promote open source contributions among Indian developers especially students. We came across the [ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Awesome Made by Russians](https://github.com/igoradamenko/awesome-made-by-russians) list and realised that a country wise awesome list would inspire local developers and also foster collaboration. 

## Contributing 

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add project to this list, please, make sure that:

1. The project was created by the developer born in India or self-indicate themself as Indian.
2. The project has more that 1000 stars on Github.

If they do, feel free to make a PR!

(Please, check twice that you have picked the correct category and added the project according to alphabetical order.)
